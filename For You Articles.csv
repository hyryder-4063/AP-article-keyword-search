,Laziness is a dirty trick to defy the Truth || Acharya Prashant (2017),Laziness - A Disease Of Too Much Intelligence,Laziness is a disease of too much intelligence and narcissism.,"Laziness is not just a superficial refusal to work hard; it's a refusal to live and learn from life. And how can one refuse to learn from life unless one is actually too intelligent, and believes that he knows and has everything within his personal mind? So, laziness is a dirty means towards the protection of the ego. And the antidote is exploration.",Sudeep
,Can't say 'No'?,Make The Right Sacrifices For Your Loved Ones,Sacrifice is about giving up something relatively small for something higher.,"Sacrifice means giving up things of little value for the sake of something higher. Therefore, it is constructive and productive - not negating or renouncing. In fact, you can't create anything worthwhile without sacrificing something relatively worthless. But in real life, the value of things is not so easy to evaluate. This is where you require wisdom - a sound value system where freedom, truth, clarity, and compassion are of high value. So, if your sacrifice is not taking you in this direction, it will not help you nor the one receiving the sacrifice.",Sudeep

In cleverness, you are still rotten, but you have managed to appear not rotten to others; so you start making profits, but they do not suffice for inner fulfillment. But in innocence, you can make profits, but don't care to; because you have realized that the very problem that made you relate to the world in a profit-seeking way is gone.",Sudeep

,"The Female Body, Chastity and 'Rape Culture'",Why Is Rape Culture So Prevalent Today?,Rape culture is a result of unconscious human beings who have fallen below animals.,"Rape is not just sex without consent. Even if consent is out of fear or greed, the act should be called rape. And this is happening everywhere. Human beings can do much better or much worse than animals. Animals mate for the sake of reproduction, but rape, from the point of view of the rapist, is recreation or entertainment for pleasure.
